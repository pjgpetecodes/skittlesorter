## What is Device Provisioning Service?

Let's start with the basics. Before we write code or create Azure resources, you need to understand what DPS does and why it matters for your IoT deployment.

Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS) is a helper service for IoT Hub that enables zero-touch, just-in-time provisioning to the right IoT hub without requiring human intervention.

## Why Use DPS?

You might be wondering: "Can't I just register devices manually in IoT Hub?" You can, but let's see why that doesn't scale:

### Traditional Approach (Manual Registration)
- Register each device manually in IoT Hub
- Hardcode connection strings in device firmware
- Difficult to reassign devices to different hubs
- Doesn't scale beyond a few devices
- Manual certificate management and rotation

### DPS Approach (Zero-Touch Provisioning)
- Devices automatically register themselves
- No connection strings hardcoded
- Devices can be reassigned dynamically
- Scales to millions of devices
- Automated certificate issuance and lifecycle management

## Key Benefits

Now that you understand the difference, here are the concrete advantages of using DPS:

### Scale
Provision thousands or millions of devices without manual intervention. Devices can self-register when they first come online.

### Security
No connection strings hardcoded in device firmware. Devices use cryptographic attestation (symmetric keys, TPM, or X.509 certificates) to prove identity.

### Flexibility
Devices can be reassigned to different IoT Hubs based on business logic, geolocation, or load balancing.

### Multi-tenancy
Different devices can automatically be directed to different IoT Hubs based on enrollment configuration.

### Separation: 
Separation between bootstrap and operational credentials for devices.

### Certificate Management
With certificate management enabled, DPS can coordinate issuance of
operational X.509 certificates through an ADR namespace certificate policy
when a device submits a CSR. Devices still need an onboarding credential to
authenticate to DPS, and certificate management is optional.

## What's New: Microsoft Certificate Management

In the current preview workflow, DPS validates the device's onboarding
credential and coordinates operational-certificate issuance through ADR:

### Traditional X.509 Workflow
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐

               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│           IoT Hub           │
└─────────────────────────────┘

Notes:
- Certs are created ahead of time and installed on devices.
- Rotation is manual: generate, distribute, and update per device.
```

### 🆕 New CSR-Based Workflow

               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│           IoT Hub           │
└─────────────────────────────┘

Notes:
- Private key never leaves the device.
- Operational certificates can be renewed according to the assigned ADR policy.
```

**Key advantages:**
- No need to manage your own CA infrastructure
- Private keys never leave the device
- Certificates issued just-in-time
- Automated lifecycle management
- Reduced operational complexity

## Azure Device Registry (ADR) Integration

Azure Device Registry (ADR) is Microsoft's **centralized device management layer** — it provides a unified registry for managing device identities, metadata, attributes, and policies independent of any single IoT platform.

Azure IoT Hub integration with ADR is in public preview and allows IoT Hub
devices to be represented and managed through ADR. Existing IoT Hubs can't be
upgraded to add the integration; create a new hub. DPS is required for every
IoT Hub preview scenario, whether or not certificate management is enabled.

### What is ADR?

ADR is a **device identity and management layer** that:
- Stores device metadata, attributes, and tags
- Manages credential policies for certificate issuance
- Decouples device identity from IoT Hub
- Enables multi-hub scenarios
- Provides query and update APIs

### What is an ADR Namespace?

An ADR namespace establishes a management and security boundary for devices represented in ADR.

A namespace can include devices connecting to different IoT Hub instances, and is where you can enable new features like Microsoft-backed X.509 certificate management (preview).

### Why ADR Matters

In traditional IoT Hub deployments:
- Device identity is tightly coupled to a specific IoT Hub
- Moving devices between hubs is complex
- Credential management is manual
- Metadata is limited

With ADR:
- ✅ Device identity is hub-independent
- ✅ Credential policies automate certificate management
- ✅ Rich metadata and tagging support
- ✅ Query devices across multiple hubs
- ✅ Update device properties programmatically

### ADR Credential Policies

Credential policies define how certificates are issued:

```json
{
  "name": "cert-policy",
  "type": "x509CA",
  "validity": "P30D",  // 30 days
  "renewalWindow": "P7D",  // Renew 7 days before expiry
  "caReference": "microsoft-managed"
}
```

During provisioning:
1. Device submits CSR to DPS
2. DPS uses credential policy from ADR
3. Certificate is signed by Microsoft-managed CA
4. Device receives certificate chain
5. Operational certificates can be renewed; consult current service guidance
   for lifecycle and revocation behavior

## Attestation Methods

Attestation is how devices prove their identity to DPS. Think of it like showing ID before boarding a flight. DPS supports three different "ID types":

### 1. Symmetric Key
- **Simplest method**
- Uses shared secret (enrollment group key)
- Device derives individual key: `HMACSHA256(groupKey, registrationId)`
- Good for development and testing
- Less secure than certificate-based methods
- 🆕 **Can be combined with CSR** - authenticate with symmetric key, receive X.509 certificate

### 2. TPM (Trusted Platform Module)
- Uses hardware security module
- Very secure
- Requires TPM chip on device
- Unique per device
- Not covered in this series

### 3. X.509 Certificate
- **Industry standard for security**
- Uses public key infrastructure (PKI)
- Supports certificate rotation
- Scalable with enrollment groups
- **Two approaches:**
  - **Traditional:** Pre-provisioned certificates
  - **🆕 CSR-based:** Certificates issued during provisioning
- **This is what we'll focus on**

## High-Level Provisioning Flow with ADR

Here's how the complete flow works with the new features:

```
┌──────────┐
│  Device  │  1. Generate CSR + private key
└────┬─────┘
     │
     │ 2. Connect to DPS with attestation
     │    (symmetric key OR X.509 bootstrap cert)
     │
     ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│       DPS       │  3. Validate attestation
│                 │  4. Check enrollment group
└────┬────────────┘  5. Query ADR for credential policy
     │
     │ 6. Submit CSR to ADR for signing
     │
     ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│       ADR       │  7. Sign CSR using credential policy
│                 │  8. Return certificate chain
└────┬────────────┘
     │
     │ 9. Return to DPS
     │
     ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│       DPS       │  10. Determine target IoT Hub
│                 │  11. Return assignment + certificate
└────┬────────────┘
     │
     │ 12. Return to device
     │
     ▼
┌──────────┐
│  Device  │  13. Install certificate
└────┬─────┘  14. Connect to assigned IoT Hub with X.509
     │
     ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  IoT Hub    │  15. Device registered and authenticated
└─────────────┘  16. Device can send telemetry
```

## Dual Attestation: Symmetric Key + X.509

One powerful pattern enabled by the new API:

1. **Phase 1 - Provisioning:** Device authenticates to DPS using **symmetric key** (simple, pre-shared)
2. **Phase 2 - Operation:** Device connects to IoT Hub using **X.509 certificate** (secure, Microsoft-issued)

**Benefits:**
- Easy initial provisioning (no pre-generated certificates)
- Secure operational communication (X.509)
- No need to distribute device certificates ahead of time
- Best of both worlds

## When to Use DPS

✅ **Use DPS when:**
- Deploying many devices (10+)
- Devices need to be reassigned between hubs
- You want zero-touch provisioning
- Security is important (no hardcoded secrets)
- You need multi-tenancy support
- You want automated certificate management
- 🆕 You want Microsoft-managed certificate issuance

🤔 **Consider if DPS is right for you if:**
- Only a few devices (< 10)
- Devices never move between hubs
- Prototyping with connection strings is acceptable

## Preview API Status

The IoT Hub integration and certificate-management capabilities covered here
remain in public preview:

- ✅ CSR-based certificate issuance
- ✅ ADR credential policies and integration with IoT Hub
- ✅ DPS MQTT protocol support
- ✅ Microsoft-managed CA

The sample application uses a custom DPS framework over MQTT for its CSR
provisioning implementation. This is a repository-specific implementation
choice, not a general requirement for IoT Hub or ADR deployments. Check
Microsoft's current documentation for API and SDK support.

> **Note:** Always check [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/iot-dps/) for the latest API status and general availability dates.

## Next Steps

In the following sections, we'll:
1. Create DPS, IoT Hub, and ADR instances
2. Configure credential policies for certificate issuance
3. Set up enrollment groups (symmetric key and X.509)
4. Build a .NET device application with custom DPS framework
5. Implement CSR generation and certificate management
6. Integrate with ADR for device management

Let's get started!
